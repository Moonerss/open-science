 * True while the observed element is narrower than `minPx` — the cue for a

 *
 * Measured on the element itself, not the viewport: what decides whether
 * "Approve for me · Build · GPT-5.6 sol" fits is the width of THAT pane, and a
 * pane is narrow for reasons a media query cannot see (a sibling pane, an open
 * inspector, the sidebar). Pane count is not a proxy either — a lone pane in a
 * small window is just as cramped.
 *
 * The first measurement happens in a layout effect, before the browser paints.
 * Waiting for the ResizeObserver's first callback instead meant every mount
 * painted the wide layout and corrected a frame later, so switching to a Screen
 * with tiled panes visibly flashed the composer and the session header from
 * icon+label down to icon.
 *
 * `laidOut` is that same guarantee for an element that mounts with NO layout:
 * an inactive Screen stays mounted but display:none, so its panes measure zero
 * until it is shown. Pass the flag that turns the box on and the measurement
 * happens in the layout effect of that very render — the observer's callback
 * would land a frame late, which is exactly the flash above.

 * twice a short one, and at 440px a pane with both overflowed — the model chip
 * squeezed until its "· effort ⌄" spilled over the send button. So the row is
 * measured: labelled, its items' natural width against the room it has; once
 * compact, what the labels cost (learned when they were dropped) is added back
 * to decide whether they fit again. Both run before paint, so a wrong guess is
 * corrected in the same frame, and learning the cost from the same content
 * means it cannot flip back and forth.
